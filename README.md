# Latexify.jl
This is a package for generating LaTeX maths from julia objects.

This package utilises Julias [homoiconicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity) to convert expressions to LaTeX-formatted strings.
Latexify.jl supplies functionalities for converting a range of different Julia objects, including:

- Expressions,
- Strings,
- Numbers (including rationals and complex),
- Symbolic expressions from SymEngine.jl,
- ParameterizedFunctions and ReactionNetworks from DifferentialEquations.jl

as well as arrays of any supported types.



### Examples
#### latexifying expressions
```julia
using Latexify
ex = :(x/(y+x)^2)
latexify(ex)
```
This generates a LaTeXString (from [LaTeXStrings.jl](https://github.com/stevengj/LaTeXStrings.jl)) which, when printed looks like:
```LaTeX
$\frac{x}{\left( y + x \right)^{2}}$
```

And when this LaTeXString is displayed in an environment that supported the tex/latex MIME type (Jupyter notebooks, Jupyterlab and Hydrogen for Atom) it will automatically render as:

#### latexifying other things
```julia
using Latexify
print(latexraw("x+y/(b-2)^2"))
```
outputs:
```LaTeX
x + \frac{y}{\left( b - 2 \right)^{2}}
```

```julia
arr = ["x/y" 3//7 2+3im; 1 :P_x :(gamma(3))]
latexify(arr)
```

### Use with DifferentialEquations.jl
The [DifferentialEquations.jl](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/stable/index.html) suite has some nifty tools for generating differential equations.
One of them is [ParameterizedFunctions](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ParameterizedFunctions.jl) which allows you to type in an ODE in something which looks very much like just plain mathematics.
The ability to latexify such ODEs is pretty much what lured me to create this package.

```julia
using DifferentialEquations
using Latexify

f = @ode_def positiveFeedback begin
    dx = v*y^n/(k^n+y^n) - x
    dy = x/(k_2+x) - y
end v n k k_2

latexify(f)
```
outputs:

[DiffEqBiological.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqBiological.jl) provides another cool domain-specific language which allows you to generate equations using a chemical arrow notation.


```julia
using DifferentialEquations
using Latexify

rn = @reaction_network demoNetwork begin
  (r_bind, r_unbind), A + B â†” C
  Hill(C, v, k, n), 0 --> X
  d_x, X --> 0
end r_bind r_unbind v k n d_x

latexify(rn)
```
![positiveFeedback](/assets/demo_rn.png)

Or you can output the arrow notation directly to latex:

```julia
latexify(rn; env=:arrow)
```
![positiveFeedback](/assets/demo_rn_arrow.png)

There are more stuff that you can do, but for that I will refer you to the
[docs](https://korsbo.github.io/Latexify.jl/stable).


## Convenience functions

- `copy_to_clipboard(::Bool)`, toggle automatic copying of the resulting LaTeX code to the clipboard (default is false).
- `auto_display(::Bool)` toggles automatic display of your output, even if it is not the last command to have run.


## Installation
This package is registered with METADATA.jl, so to install it you can just run

```julia
Pkg.add("Latexify")
```

## Further information
For further information see the [docs](https://korsbo.github.io/Latexify.jl/stable).
